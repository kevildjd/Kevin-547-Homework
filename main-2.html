    Here's Mike, the modern-day Midas, but with a twist. His touch doesn't turn things into gold â€“ his vacuum does! While most of us find crumbs and lost socks, Mike's cleaning sessions are like a treasure hunt on his very own living room floor. Next time you're vacuuming and lamenting life's chores, just remember: somewhere out there, Mike's vacuum is turning dust into dollars!
